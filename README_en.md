# Collaborative WebApp to manage serials deduplication in libraries.

Save space by eliminating duplicates, provide better readability of your collections by restoring for each of them a unique collection as clean as possible resulting from the aggregation of scattered items available in your libraries.

# Method:

For a given resource (Catalog Unit without filiations), "eplouribousse" allows libraries, each in turn, to indicate its bound elements contributing to the resulting collection, then in a second cycle of instructions and according to the same logic, its not bound complementary elements.

The order of processing is significant: The first library is normally the one already holding the most important collection (the one that claims conservation in the event that the collection is finally grouped). It is the same logic of importance that must prevail normally for the place claimed by the following libraries. It may happen that a library wants to subtract its collection to the reconstitution of the resultant (The typical case is that of a collection of the legal deposit) The positioning module of "eplouribousse" makes this derogation possible.

The sheets obtained describe the resulting collection ; the eliminated elements are deduced from this description (all that doesn't contribute to the resulting collection) The elements which contributes to the resulting collection may be grouped together or not, as desired. Physical treatments and catalog updates are expected.

# How to get eplouribousse?

In order to have an idea of what it turns about and what it looks, we first recommand to take a tour on one of these real instances :
01. https://eplouribousse1.di.unistra.fr/
02. https://eplouribousse2.di.unistra.fr/
03. https://eplouribousse3.di.unistra.fr/

----------------

It looks good ? Let's try it on your desktop with the Django development server ; this will allow you to test all features (Mail alerts will be edited in the console).

Debian Linux users : follow the step-by-step instructions in Doc/howto.txt

----------------

You're OK and you want the real one with all the conveniences ?
We recommend that you first approach your IT team for a test installation.

If you want to use eplouribousse for a firm project, there are three possibilities at the moment :
- Entrust the deployment to your IT department by indicating the address of this site
- Entrust the deployment to a host indicating the address of this site
- We entrust the deployment (subject to agreement)

In all cases, let us know that you're interested (see contact below)

# Instructions for deployment:

- The deployment tool having been coded in python 2.7, it will first be necessary to create a virtual environment under which we will install this version of python,
- Deployment shall be done with the tool pydiploy <https://pypi.org/project/pydiploy/> (installation with the command 'pip install pydiploy', in the virtual environment),
- The use of pydiploy implies the creation of an ad-hoc fabfile on the model of those provided in the repository (example <https://github.com/GGre/eplouribounistra/blob/master/fabfile_eplouribousse1.py>),
- It is also necessary to install reportlab open source <https://pypi.org/project/reportlab/> (for the generation of pdf files),
- Attention : Django secret key kept secret in public respository (**/settings/secret_key.py in .gitignore)
