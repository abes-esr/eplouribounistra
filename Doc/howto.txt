This is a how to do step by step to test eplouribousse in a virtual environment (with Debian Linux systems)

NB : command lines follows action to realize.

Open a terminal,

----------------

# step 1 : Verify python version ; it must be at least 3.5 :

$ python3

If all is ok, you should see something like that * :

Python 3.5.2 (default, Apr 16 2020, 17:47:17)

[GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux

Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

>>>

exit with Ctrl-D

(*) If not, contact a computer scientist.
----------------

# step 2 : Create your virtual environment to work with without any risk to go wrong with your system (let's name this virtual environment djangodev) :

$ python3 -m venv ~/.virtualenvs/djangodev

If it doesn't work, it's probably beacause venv has to be installed with amdin rights (the following command line is for a Debian distribution) :

$ sudo apt-get install python3-venv

----------------

# step 3 : Activate your virtual environment, install there what is required i.e. Django 2.2.12 (it's a LTS version) and Reportlab :

$ workon djangodev

(djangodev) appears now.

install Django 2.2.12 (LTS) (no problem since pip is included in python from version 3.5) :

$ pip install Django==2.2.12

you may verify you have the right version :

$ python -m django --version

Now install Reportlab (the tool to get nice pdf reports) :

$ python -m pip install reportlab

----------------

# step 4 : Create a repository where to settle all the stuff you need :

Clone https://git.unistra.fr/gressot/yellow in a directory of your own,

download the archive file https://seafile.unistra.fr/f/87c1f540667c4fcb93b7/?dl=1

uncompress and extract this file (i.e. the database : eplouribousse.db) Settle it in yellow (the directory where you can find the file manage.py)

----------------

# Ã©tape 5 : run the development server and test :

Change to directory where manage.py takes place :

$ cd home/path/to/yellow/

export the right settings fitted to the repository structure :

$ export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=eplouribousse.settings.dev

then run development server :

$ python manage.py runserver

Ctrl + Clic on the link 127.0.0.1:8000/

Then you can play !

For any authentication use first name as identifier and testeplou as temporary password (the same for all identifiers)

This is a playground with three libraries : John works for Swallow library, Susan for Magpie library, Petra for Raven library, Clara is the checker, Flora is the database administrator, Alan is the site administrator and you are Joyce the super user. Discover what they can do, which rights they have, how they can interact with the app.

At the end of the test, don't forget to deactivate the virtual environment with the command :

$ deactivate

----------------
